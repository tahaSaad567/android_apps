    <p><strong>Last Updated: Sept 28, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how MySalary ("we," "us," or "our") handles your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>MySalary is designed with your privacy in mind. We collect the following types of information:</p>

    <h3>a) Information You Provide:</h3>
    <p>All data you enter into the salary calculator is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Basic Salary</li>
      <li>Allowances</li>
      <li>Overtime Hours, Absent Days, and Other Deductions</li>
      <li>Calculation preferences such as hours per day and days in a month.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is used solely for the purpose of calculating your salary and maintaining your salary history within the App on your device. <strong>We do not have access to this data, and it is not transmitted to our servers.</strong></p>

    <h3>b) Automatically Collected Information (for Advertising):</h3>
    <p>The App uses Google AdMob, a third-party advertising service. AdMob may collect and use non-personally identifiable information to provide personalized ads. This may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Such as your device model, operating system version, and mobile network information.</li>
      <li><strong>Log Information:</strong> Such as your IP address.</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising Identifiers:</strong> Such as Google Advertising ID.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is collected by Google and is subject to Google's Privacy Policy. We do not store this information on our servers. For more details on how Google uses this data, please visit <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Google's Privacy & Terms</a>.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>To Provide App Functionality:</strong> The salary data you provide is used to perform calculations and display your salary history, as requested by you. This data remains on your device.</li>
      <li><strong>To Provide and Improve Advertising:</strong> Data collected by Google AdMob is used to serve relevant advertisements and to help us keep the App free.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>All salary-related data you enter is stored locally on your device using secure internal storage. You have full control over this data and can delete it at any time from the "Salary History" page within the App.</p>
    <p>Since this sensitive data is not transmitted to us, the security of your data largely depends on the security of your own device. We recommend using a secure lock screen and keeping your device's operating system up to date.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> For displaying advertisements. Their data handling practices are governed by their own privacy policy.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Play Services:</strong> For core application functionalities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Sharing Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not share your personal salary information with anyone. The App provides features that allow <strong>you</strong> to share your salary records or export them as a CSV file. This action is initiated entirely by you, and you are responsible for who you share this information with.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
